Maggie Paragraph:
My favorite species from the list is the red tree vole. I am not as interested in plants when it comes to this specific project, which narrowed the list a bit. I am also more interested in the species which are found in Oregon, and red tree voles are often found in the northeast portion of Oregon specifically, close to the Lewis & Clark College campus. The red tree vole also stood out to me as the only rodent on the list, a subset of animals I have slightly more interest in in. Finally, when I looked this species up I also noticed that they are the prey to another species on this list, the Northern Spotted Owl which could make the conservation efforts towards this species compelling.
