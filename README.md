## Species: Fisher 

Maggie Paragraph:
My favorite species from the list is the red tree vole. I am not as interested in plants when it comes to this specific project, which narrowed the list a bit. I am also more interested in the species which are found in Oregon, and red tree voles are often found in the northeast portion of Oregon specifically, close to the Lewis & Clark College campus. The red tree vole also stood out to me as the only rodent on the list, a subset of animals I have slightly more interest in in. Finally, when I looked this species up I also noticed that they are the prey to another species on this list, the Northern Spotted Owl which could make the conservation efforts towards this species compelling. 

Fiona Paragraph:
My favorite species on the list is the Little Brown Bat. I love bats in general, and specifically for this project I want to look at an animal not a plant. I also know that bat populations overall have been declining due to climate change and the emergence of diseases and fungal infections, like white-nose syndrome. 

Zayd Paragrapgh: One of my favorite animals is the spotted hyena. Their unique social structure and intricate form (but weird) of communication is fascinating. I find it interesting that they have massive groups called clans which are matriarchal groups.These clans can have up to 100 members! They are much more intelligent than people believe and I hope to meet one in the future!

Devna's Paragraph: My favorite animal on this list is the Northern Spotted Owl. For this project, I was most interested in looking at an animal, specifically one that is native to Oregon. This species stood out to me because I had previously learned a bit about its conservation and the key role it plays as an indicator species, as it lives exclusively in old-growth forests in the Western Cascades and coast of Oregon. The NSO is also one of the primary predators of the red tree vole, another speceis on the list, whcih I thought was interesting.
